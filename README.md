# spreadsheet-project

u/thesuperspy started this project to replicate the financial spreadsheets from u/DeepFuckingValue's YouTube streams. This latest version has a lot of improvements and even has features DFV's original sheets didn't have.

Volunteer: Want to help test new versions or other tools folks are making? There is now a Discord for test versions, recommendations, requests, bug reporting, etc. You can also get other tools folks are working on (e.g. DFV's fundamental analysis sheet, social media sock trackers, etc.). This version would not be ready without the help of everyone there.

Universe v0.7d: The "Universe" sheet is your universe of stocks that you're willing to invest in. It is basically a database with information about companies from all over the world along with your notes on the stocks.

Tracker v0.7d: The "Tracker" spreadsheet consolidates data about commodities, indexes, stocks, and industries. It also acts as a portfolio tracker and helps to identify stocks that are worth investigating based on valuation indicators, insider buying, or other criteria
